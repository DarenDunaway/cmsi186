Minute hand:

360% / 60 mins
36 / 6
6 / 1
6 / 60 secs

Hour hand:

360% / 12 hours
30% / 60 mins
0.5 / minutes
0.5 / 60 seconds

Tick size:
- *Determines the angles of the clock hand at specific time intervals*
- *Keep track of Delta*
Ex: 0.01 tick size(1 sec) you would have 43200 ticks(seconds) in 12 hours

Zero degrees = new hour

Time Slice:
- <=1800.0
- Should handle int arguments like 23
- check for strings

WHILE totalSeconds are less than 43200 || true KEEP LOOPING

When the angles match, PRINT hh:mm:ss by calculating total seconds, minutes, and hours
